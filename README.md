# Dog Catalog App

This app is a catalog of clothes for dogs. The web app has two types of pages, one page with a list of items that could be filtered by categories and one page for the item details. The app also collects information data from the [API Financial Modeling Grep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/) to display different prices to the items.
